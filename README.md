## Purpose

In September 2000, leaders from 189 nations agreed on a set of development goals that were created to measure develompent progress towrds less poverty, hunger and disease, greater survival prospects for mothers and their infants, better educated children, equal opportunities for women, and a healthier environment. This manifested in the “ Millennium Development Goals”, 8 Goals which provide a framework of time-bound targets. 

### Goals
1.	Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
2.	Achieve universal primary education
3.	Promote gender equality and empower women
4.	Reduce Child Mortality
5.	Improve Maternal Health
6.	Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other disease
7.	Ensure environmental sustainability
8.	Develop a global partnership for development

In close collaboration with agencies and organizations within and outside the United Nations system, the United Nations Statistics Division has coordinated the preparation of data analysis to assess progress made towards the MDGs and maintains the database containing the data series related to the selected indicators, as well as other background series intended to supplement the official indicators. 

This Django project is built to view the data gathered for the United Nations Millenium Goals in a digestable format!
